# chemistry
A website for students to learn about chemistry.

## TODO

This should be transformed to a common static site generator like
Pelican or Jekyll. The 'admin' part and the 'db' part is (was) only for my own
static site generator. The code base is aweful.

However, for switching to Pelican or Jekyll you only need to import the db
files to a MySQL database. Then you can easily create the files in the format
you want from the `articles` table.
